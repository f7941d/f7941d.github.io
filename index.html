      <h2>Additional information:</h2>
      <p>
        IP and Owner are removed from the device info, because it is considered
        sensitive information.
      </p>
      <p>
        ⚠️ (Password Unknown/Forgotten) - when used <code>netsh wlan show profile key="clear"</code> on the network, no password was returned (the network was forgotten)
      </p>
      <p>
        ✅ (Password Verified) - one of the passwords (the underlined one) is the correct network password
      </p>
      <p>
        ❌ (Password Unverified) - none of the passwords are correct

      <h2>How it works:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><code>netsh wlan show profiles</code> is ran</li>
        <li>all known networks are extracted</li>
        <li><code>netsh wlan show profile name="{name}" key=clear</code> is ran for each of the extracted networks, <code>key=clear</code> makes the password plain text</li>
        <li>The password is extracted from each one, and saved into a variable</li>
        <li><code>curl ifcfg.me</code> is ran, to get the public IP of the device (not used)</li>
        <li><code>systeminfo</code> is ran, to get the System Manufacturer, Model, OS Name, Host Name, and Owner of the device</li>
        <li>Everything is saved into variable with the json syntax</li>
        <li>All info is sent using the Telegram Bot Get API</li>
        <li>The received message is uploaded to GitHub, where the website automatically updates</li>
      </ol>
